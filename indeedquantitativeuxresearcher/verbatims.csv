"1 out of 10 shows up for interviews"
"1 out of 50 has the qualifications that we ask for."
"1.  We got nowhere near the number of applicants projected by your system. 2.  We did not get even ONE candidate who met our specifications.3.  While we ended up hiring the one applicant who had any skills close to what we needed, he ended up to not be a good fit and we had to let him go within a week."
"1. Applicants who do not qualify apply.2. Applicants don’t read the instructions for interviewing.3. I don’t have time to communicate to each applicant- it’s like a needle in a haystack. I’m wasting my time replying to people who I would never hire."
"1. CandidAte screening stinks.2. You provide no way for me to cancel ad"
"12-14 resumes, 2 showed up for an interview, 4 no showed."
"95% of applicants that you sent  were not qualified. the other 5% were just looking to fill there unemployment quota."
"A good way to seek candidates for the sort of position we are offering."
"A large number of candidates looked at the posting, however, some followed- up on how to actually apply. My position requires someone to be at least 21 years old, but I am not allowed to put this on the initial posting. For a law enforcement job, there should be more background-type questions to help narrow down a viable candidate."
"A lot of candidates who were not applicable to the job description"
"A number of candidates do not show up for the interviews.  I've also had to fire people I've found on Indeed due to poor work performance or attendance."
"A reasonable amount of candidates that met the minimum requirements"
"ADS SHOULD NOT AUTO DEACTIVATE WE SHOULD DO IT ONCE WE HIRE OUR STAFF"
"Able to create a detail posting and received detailed resumes."
"Above average in customer service!"
"Access was great. Exposure to candidates was great. Tailoring applications for our needs was not great because it added an time-consuming step for me."
"Account won't allow jobs to be posted"
"After spending several hundred dollars. none of the candidates we received even remotely matched our needs."
"All the staff we hired via indeed have been excellent."
"All your cantatas if they are real to begin with are JUNK! Hundreds of Apps and never could get 1 to come in for an interview. Over 95% wouldn't not even answer your call or email back. A Huge Waste of Time, $$$$ and Resources.."
"Almost all the resumes I received were from people that were not close to being qualified for the position I posted for. Completely wrong catagory."
"Alot of people to choose from."
"Alot of people use your service ."
"Already had two people apply"
"Although I found the candidate in a fairly quick fashion, I keep receiving calls and emails asking if I’m still looking even though I’ve responded saying that I found someone AND removing the position."
"Although we clearly stated that if the person did not have the required minimum experience and educational background, THEY SHOULD NOT APPLY, we still received many applications and resumes from persons who DID NOT HAVE ANY RELEVANT EXPERIENCE. I want to tell them but didn't - THANKS FOR WASTING OUR TIME!"
"Always changing things"
"Always had success in hiring in a timely manner for all three of my companies"
"Amazing results for recrutting.  Thanks"
"Annoying emails"
"App screening process"
"Applicant majority of the time are not serious about getting a job.They don’t  email back or answer the phone. And it’s really expensive."
"Applicants didn't seem to read the job requirements and would apply with absolutely zero experience"
"Applicants had no relevant experience for the jobs posted. Indeed should not ""attempt"" to match candidates with perspective employers. I spent an excessive amount of time going through resumes and applications that were not at all relevant."
"Applicants usually don't have the qualifications listed in the posting."
"As a job seeker I would give your site an 8. I have never been through the process of job interviews so I can not score it higher then that."
"As a recruiter I believe that your business model does not work well with our business model. It should just be a flat fee for the ad and not based on ""clicks"". I should not be charged for resumes with irrelevant experience and that do not match the job description and requirements as listed."
"Assessment wasn't the best"
"Availability, many employers use, and user friendly"
"BS Sales Pitches and NO RESULTS, then terrible service"
"Back in April you all were having system issues where a applicant could not answer my 5 questions and their Resume came in all scrambled. I reach out and no one had an answer for me. They just gave me a refund. Also  I had asked for a Manager to call me about your sales rep, Amanda Joho several times and I never received a call.  Now I tried to post another position and am having the same problem."
"Bad quality of candidates and on my last post, I got barely any candidates and the ones I did, weren't even living in my state."
"Bad selection qualified also under qualified"
"Because I cannot have the candidates email me directly and I receive way to many emails from Indeed."
"Because I have not had qualified canidates to try and hire someone."
"Because I spent $500 and didn’t get a single hire"
"Because each time I have used Indeed I ask for help and on one gets back to me."
"Because it is an effective way to advertise & attract prospective employees & reasonable cost."
"Because it was supposed to be free, and in order to scan money, my profile was pulled and then I had to prove who I was, and when I got it back, suddenly I had to pay to post a job. So I switched to another source."
"Because it worked !"
"Because the option to require a cover letter is no longer there, I got a ton of applicants that would not even be considered. Please add this function back."
"Because the person i hired is the best"
"Because we have hired through you and like the website"
"Because we realize that so many job seekers turn to indeed to find jobs"
"Because when i pay for the service i get hardly no hits, and unqualified people. I spend hundreds of dollars and it is wasted."
"Because you can communicate and connect to many people"
"Because you nickel and dime and send people to me over and over again that I have rejected. Why would you send me someone that I rejected."
"Because your quick at gettinf people or companies to respond fast"
"Better applications"
"Better quality of applicants than other sites."
"Billing and charges are not transparent.Results are not consistent."

"Both time we have used Indeed we found excellent employees both who live in our area."
"Bunch of not related, unfiltered, not requested qulification resumes"

"CANDIDATES ARE UNQUALIFIED"
"Can't post for free. Always need to sponsor jobs"
"Candidate left less than one week after hire. Huge training expense. Left with having to find another candidate."
"Candidates did not meet exceptions needed for the position with the majority of the candidates not answering phone for phone interview or the scheduled interview at the  retail location after email for the interview with the candidate."
"Candidates did not meet my requirements. In the hiring world, that feels like SPAM."
"Candidates do not know they apply with us"
"Candidates ghosting us when we contact them.  No accountability for the candidate to the potential employer."
"Candidates that applied to my job postings were not quality"
"Candidates that apply do not have the required skills."
"Candidates that were NOT AT ALL qualified for the job we advertised, were able to respond to our AD and we were charged a fee.  These people were obviously just looking for any job they could find and we were recruiting for an EXPERIENCED painter."
"Candidates that were sent to us did not respond to us when we reached out to them via telephone. The one or two that did, never showed up for the interview. Some were not a good fit for a labor position."
"Candidates/resumes are relevant to my company's needs. We found a rockstar."
"Charge too much for small businesses"
"Charges are vague."
"Continuing to bill me after I have closed a Job, which is how your website instructs your customers to stop billing. To no avail. Lastly, the applicants that I received were not qualified, did not complete the questions I requested and it led to an extremely lengthy and unsuccessful process."

"Did not find anyone for the job."
"Did not get any quality applicants from are post."
"Did not get any real employee leads"
"Did not like the experience. I feel that indeed now wants the customer to budget higher per day in order to get any resumes. It used to be better before but the last 2 times- I felt that resumes filtered through are poor."
"Did not receive any good candidates which equals a waste of my marketing dollars. I learned that you need to spend a large amount of money to get your ads at the top of the list. So if you don't have a large budget, you shouldn't waste your time with it."
"Did not receive candidates with experience requested.  Most of the candidates I set up interviews with did not even show up."
"Did not work"
"Did not yield kind of candidates we needed -- and the cost was going up to fast."
"Didn't get any qualified candidates with experience and job knowledge"

"First I'd like to say that your employee Colleen Holt absolutely ROCKS as a customer-facing representative to your company!  She has always been responsive, professional, and timely in her interactions/requests from me when getting up&running on Indeed.  The reason for the 9 score is due to getting extremely unqualified candidates applying after 5-7 days to very technical, terminal-degreed job postings I placed with your company."
"For the most part its good, but sometimes I get over qualified candidates."

Was very shocked these people would take the time to respond yet none of them followed thru with the second step of applying for the job.  Very discouraging."
"Had great results"
"Had many applications to choose from."

"I am not happy the way you are treating your customer."
"I am not sure what I was charged for.  The billing is not clear, it appears it may be based on clicks?  90% of the resumes that were sent to my email were not even relevant. So I was charged for opening a file and deleting it.  I found 2 people which I called on.  Scheduled an interview and they didn't even show up.  I ended up using a professional placement agency.  If there is a way to close my account with Indeed I would like it shut down and all my information purged.  What waste of time and money."
"I am very pleased with Indeed's ability to publicize the availability of the positions at my office, as well as pleasantly pleased with Indeed's assistance in the administration of the responses received and delivered to my email.  Nice job."

"I can no longer post without paying"
"I can prescreened applicants."
"I could post easily to find employees"
"I did get a lot of applicants however 80% of them were not in the culinary field. I was looking for a grill cook and I got responses from carpenters, electricians, baby sitters, computer technicians etc... I don't blame Indeed for that, it's just that I spent over $500 and I ended up hiring someone who transferred from another account."
"I did get a lot of responses but the candidates were not qualified at all.  I am looking for skilled labor in the carpentry field and all I got were people who worked warehouse or a cashier somewhere.  I've tried indeed a few times and spent a lot of money and have not even received one quality candidate."

"I did not receive the response from qualified applicants. The copy was very clear as to the qualifications."

That was largely due to the position offered, and the environment of Indeed being conducive to blue collar agricultural work.  I filled the position from another site, but Indeed was easy enough to create a posting for."
"I didn't get much value from posting on indeed, craigslist did muuch better."
"I didn’t know I was being charged until it hit my card.  I never picked to have a sponsored ad. It was only like 11$ so not a huge deal but better communication might be in order."

"I feel as though it is as good as the effort we put into it."
"I feel like indeed is a scam! Just trying to get you to spend more money and get ridiculous results."
"I feel like there are surprise costs involved. When I place an ad and I set a limit it seems to go over. (not interested in someone calling me about it either to ""train me"") In addition if I just go looking for caregivers I have to pay additionally to view profiles."

"I had great response from qualified applicants"
"I had many applications to review and choices to hire."

"I have had good success with getting candidates but I asked two others in my group to begin recruiting on Indeed for other purposes and they could not get ""certified"" to use Indeed. Note that they are in the same company as I am with similar emails. It took over a week of sending docs back and forth with silly requirements that PDFs are not acceptable. Really? So we just printed the PDF and then took a picture or it and submitted that. However, it just proved too difficult so they gave up on Indeed and used a different platform for recruiting and are happy with it so will stay with that in the future."

"I have had luck with the candidates that replied to my indeed ad."
"I have hired a few people from indeed, but I've had may more people who were unresponsive than people that I have hired."
"I have hired people through Indeed and find it convenient.  The only problem I have is that I set up appointments for interviews and the interviewee is very often a no-show.  I know you have no control over what people do but it is so annoying."
"I have not had any applicants."
"I have not used your company or any of the referrals you said you had for me because I do not understand how you operate.  I cannot recommend something I did not use and do not understand.  I would be very willing to dialog with someone to get more information.  I anticipate another staff opening in about two months."
"I have now hired two employees through Indeed."
"I have only hired two people off of indeed out of the hundreds of candidates they have provided. The reason for that is only two of them had the rail experience they said they did and could get a ride to work. The one of them I hired by the name of Fred Luna ended up being a child molester and almost ruined my whole company oh, the other one by the name of Noah Craig is now in prison for robbing my customers and me and pawning all of our stuff for drug money. So that's the reason. I figured that should be enough"
"I have tried to talk to a representative about our company needs and options."
"I have used Indeed before and is very happy"
"I have used indeed for the past year and spent a lot of money but never get qualified candidates."
"I have used indeed twice once just using the free services and 2nd paid service. I never received one applicant from either. Not to mention of all the resumes I reached out to. Only 1 had the courtesy to respond and she was not longer looking yet her resume was still on your system."
"I have used this services for my personal use and finding job candidates."
"I have used you before and had great success.  This time I had very few applicants and the ones I had were terrible. Some didn't even have any of the qualifications I asked for in the ad. For our industry we need a certification.  I had bartenders, servers, hostesses etc. No certification at all."
"I haven't found any good therapists using your system. Too many issues to list."
"I haven't made one single hire from using this tool, in fact most of the candidates I engaged with using Indeed didn't make it past the first technical round of interviews."
"I hired a great staff for the summer."
"I hired someone and she literally left my office in the middle of the first day and never returned."
"I hired two people using your site"
"I invested in your company to get qualified people and you sent the most unqualified candidates I have ever seen. One of your representatives contacted me due to my dissatisfaction and convinced me to invest $500. 00 to enhance my post and the same unqualified people  responded sucking out my $500.00 investment with in a weeks time in which you then required more money to keep my add running. You do not have my interest in mind. Just YOUR bottom line!"
"I keep calling to get my billing corrected and they still keep charging my credit card"
"I like the cost system and high rank in search result from candidate point of view"
"I like the fact that we can get a daily email for the newest applications."
"I liked being able to post job ad on the site."
"I liked the customer service I received from your representative when I was setting up the ad. We also received a decent amount of responses to the ad."
"I list the ad they want you to pay for ad saying you will generate ""X"" amount of applicates. You receive the same amount if you pay for the ad or you don't. Neither gets you a lot of applicates. Also ask for specific qualifications and driving experience and out of maybe 8 applicates I do get 1 or 2 have the necessary qualifications. They send you applicants who don't fit your criteria."
"I never get qualified leads"
"I never got anyone to come for the job  I paid extra money to get a better qualified person and still never got anyone I also thought the billing  that you took out of my account was not accurate and was not fair   To keep taking money when I stop the service"
"I never had a viable candidate.  None showed up for interviews.  Others never returned calls.  I think most were just trying to prove that they had an appointment to keep the unemployment office at bay.  Also, your cost was astronimical.  I spend thousands of dollars and still don't have a person to fill my position.  Your analytics bilked my company out of a lot of money for nothing so show for it.  I am not recommending your firm.  Sorry."
"I only got ex cons and drug addicts."
"I only heard from applicants who didn't fit any of my criteria.I feel that it is too expensive to perform so poorly."
"I only needed 1 painter and over a hundred applied via e-mail and of those, only 7 yes 7 had any experience in house painting.You charged me CLOSE TO $400.00! It has shown up on my charge card.Please reverse this amount."
"I paid $150 for my adds and did not even get one single resume! I’ve used indeed before never paid that much and had better results. I’m not sure what has changed but it was so disappointing."
"I paid a lot and got no qualified candidates."
"I quite literally had zero applicants...not sure my ad was even running"
"I really didn't get the caliber of candidates that I needed. My position remains open."
"I really don't understand how it works.  I placed an ad and got 50 or so responses but none of the applicants seemed to have actually read the job description.  It's like you have an automatic reply option for employees to apply for everything.  It was a waste of time.  Then, someone from Indeed called and said I had an unfavorable rating?  What is that about?"
"I receive a very good quantity of applicants and the entire Indeed system is very easy to use."
"I received a lot of resumes to choose from"
"I received a lot of unqualified resumes based on what my criteria was"
"I received applications from several qualified candidates.  More than other sites that I have used."
"I received help in rewriting our add. I received regular calls seeing how applicants were coming. The site helped narrow down applicants to those that were more qualified."
"I received many applicant replies so quickly - like overnight.  Putting in the information regarding the job was easy."
"I received many application from indeed but 95% of the candidates did not have the required experience or skills."
"I received many applications and was able to find the prefect preson for the position i was looking for"
"I received many applications that were quite good.  Most importantly I hired a wonderful young man to fill our position.  Thank you indeed!"
"I received many responses  and set up interviews with approximately 15.  Interview appointments came and went with only 2 people showing up. One person called to say he had a family emergency, but never called back to re-schedule.  Everyone else neither called nor showed.  It makes me wonder why they're bothering to set up interviews.  Is it used for unemployment?  I've talked with my professional peers and they're also having a hard time with staffing.  Child Care is not a lucrative field so many people can't afford to take our jobs.  But this was very weird."
"I received quality candidates that had the skills I was looking for"
"I received so many responses!"
"I received some good candidates for reception and technician"
"I received very little response."
"I scheduled interview after interview and no one would show up. They kept recommending candidates and they had no relevance and would not show up. The ones that did were problems and had terrible attitudes and we had to terminate them within the week. You charged me over $150 to use this service and I wasn't able to hire anyone from here. I think it's easy to say things wasted your time, but this truly was. I needed to hire someone right away and thought this would be a good resource. What's more, you would not stop calling my business phone AND my personal cell phone to solicit further add on services, even after I said no."
"I specified the requirements for the job i posted, and got plenty of responses, but not one applicant came close to the requirements that resided within about 20 miles.  I wasted my time and money on the listing and going through resume's that should never have been sent for review."
"I spent 200.00 and did not ever get one interview with anyone I reached out to.  Some applicants were not even close to what I had advertised for and many were way too far away to commute .  I felt like it was fugazy applications simply to satisfy their unemployment obligations."
"I spent a bunch of money and didn't find anyone.  I did, however, find someone with the free advertising."
"I spent hundreds of dollars and did not find a candidate."
"I think INDEED sent us qualified candidates, and we appreciate it.Thank you."
"I think for some job types its a good source but for others it mot very good.  Pay a lot for clicks that end up being a total waste of time"
"I think it is a little tricky to navigate and it needs to be more clear you are being charged and that it will be daily.  So at the end before pressing okay, there should be a rundown of what you are wanting to do and how much you are doing in terms of dollars spending"
"I think the applicants are bots. Not all of them but a signifigant portion."
"I think the platform is great for  finding candidates to match to the position"
"I think the program is very well run, well structured and has a good reach"
"I think you website could improve and make it a little more simple to enter data."
"I thought the service brought in a fair amount of candidates."
"I used Indeed about 6 months ago and while I received a number of candidates that had absolutely no skills for the job posting, I thought the price I paid was fair. This time the price was at least 3 times what I paid previously and received little in the way of qualified candidates."
"I was able to advertise my job posting for free. A significant number of applications were received. A quality employee was hired."
"I was able to find a candidate from indeed"
"I was able to get candidates that I could hire."
"I was actually going to not even finish filling out the post.  You guys called me and helped me finish.  I had a new employee in a few days after that."
"I was charged amounts for ads that I didn't approve.  I tried calling and discussing the charges and it wasn't resolved.  I was charged almost $500 that wasn't authorized.  I will tell everyone to NEVER use Indeed due to this.  I have used you for over 20 years and won't due to this."
"I was charged for bogus resumes that came in on my posting. I had no idea I would be charged per resume. I had a doughnut clerk apply for my attorney posting!!! I was charged."
"I was charged over $300 without my consent."
"I was happy with the quality of candidates that I received from Indeed for the position that I was hiring for."
"I was impressed with the website."
"I was not able to find a candidate most would schedule and not show up to interviews."
"I was not able to find qualified people"
"I was not able to hire one employee through indeed.  Practically all of them were very far from my facility."
"I was not satisfied with the type of applicants that I received.  The cost of what I received was not worth it."
"I was overcharged and avoided when I asked to speak to a manager quite a few times.  This is the second time I did this poll!"
"I was satisfied with how many applicants I received from indeed. There was a real disappointment in the lack of scheduled and confirmed interview turn outs.  I was also disappointed in the amount of return applicants that I had turned away on previous postings."
"I was told I should pay more money to get more exposure for my position to hopefully get canidates.  I had one interview.  Of all the other people that looked at my position no one else contacted me after I sent them an email.  I paid 600.00 for your service to get no one.  It makes me very angry.  Money wasted."
"I was unable to find any responsible applicant. Most had no experience.Disappointed."
"I was under the impression that there was some kind of Vetting process, but I had some super sketchy people show up. One was a convicted felon to grand larceny, she came one day and never showed back up, after doing my own research I found her criminal recors. The program is a pain to use and over half the time people don't even show up to the interview. Basically Indeed was a mess to deal with."
"I wasn't getting quality applicants for the cost of the ads."
"I waste a lot of time sorting thru resumes that are not relevant to my open position regardless of the criteria I put in the ad.  Applicants just check yes to all the requirements and the resumes get passed along anyway."
"I would have given a 10 because we received many good candidates for the position but we also received many that had no qualifications and had to really review resumes.  Great way to find new employees."
"I would like to just use Indeed without someone contacting me over the phone trying to upsell me. ."
"I would not recommend Indeed if you are a hiring manager. I was difficult to filter the candidates."
"I would rather be able to look at resumes and respond that way.  A lot of the people that respond to the ad are just doing it to met a quota."
"I would say that 80% of the applicants that respond to our ad and set up interviews  with us  never show up. Very disappointing, don't know if they are just making contacts or what. Its tough getting good help for good pay...."
"I'm not getting great applicants. The screening is not as thorough as I'd like."
"I'm not happy with response.  98% of people response with no experience.  I asked for experience only.  Should be filter by your company."
"I've gotten some good resumes for some positions, but none for others."
"I've spent time and money using Indeed and have found lots of unsuitable responses."
"IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I'VE EVER SIGNED UP FOR-WHAT A SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If you don’t pay you get nothing"
"If you really want to know what I think, which you don’t, then call me at (201) 755-9920"
"Immediate response. More beneficial."
"In general, we find qualified employees."
"In my experience, Indeed is fine for casting a wide net.  The reach is extensive. But it also often generates large quantities of applications from candidates who do not appear to have any relevance to our position.  Using Indeed means we have to sift through many unqualified applications to find the ones that are actually competitive.  Sometimes we're willing to do that, often we're not."
"In spite of filters most candidates di not have the minimum qualifications."
"Inconsistent policy and changes that tallows free job posting mainly for start-up companies"
"Increases your options for candidates"
"Indeed can be a great tool for jobseekers."
"Indeed can be helpful for advertising employment needs. However, with each post, I am guaranteed to get at least 50% clicks from individuals that in no way meet the job description. Specificially, I use Indeed to look for psychologists or therapists, and each time that I post a position, I get random applicants with interest in IT, restaurant server, office manager - something completely unrelated to the job description. Because of this, I often feel that my budget is not being used efficiently if 50% of the applicants are not viable options."
"Indeed did help us find our hire that we would have never found on our own but had trouble navigating the website.  To wordy, to many places giving the same info And made it confusing."
"Indeed ended up costing us twice as much as we initially made to believe - really expensive. Plus, most of the candidates did not fulfill any of the requirements we had asked for. We weren't able to hire a single person through Indeed. Very disappointing."
"Indeed has a great reputation and their assessment tests help me weed out unsuitable candidates."
"Indeed has a lot of followers and we get a lot of resumes to choose from."
"Indeed has been really helpful for finding candidates. My posts seem to reach a wide array of candidates and I have hired some excellent instructors."
"Indeed has help me gain a lot of loyal employees."
"Indeed has proved to be a great addition to our toolbox for hiring."
"Indeed is a great resource and most of my hires come from Indeed."
"Indeed is a great resource but we found applicants were out there that had already found employment or for unemployment reasons kept it posted."
"Indeed is a great service to use!"
"Indeed is a great tool to use for searching for candidates. The reason why I did not give a 10, and this may not be your fault but it seems the quality of people are low and there is a high percentage of no shows when setting up interviews."
"Indeed is a very effective source that really know how to appeal to job seekers."
"Indeed is a widely used website for job seekers."
"Indeed is an excellent resource for finding qualified candidates. Almost all candidates met the qualifications needed."
"Indeed is easy quick and free!"
"Indeed is easy to use and you get a bunch of candidates.  Not all qualified, but a bunch of candidates."
"Indeed is fairly easy to use, but in order to get real results, you have to pay for your listing. My other BIG problem was that people would apply, schedule an interview and then not show up. While I know this cannot be controlled by Indeed, it would be nice if there was a way of filtering out candidates who apply for everything/anything for ""unemployment"" reasons. I am quite sure that many of the applicants I had were just trying to be able to say that they applied for so many jobs in the past 30 days so that they could continue to get their benefits."
"Indeed is just one of many job sites, and one that is suddenly unfriendly to recruiters."
"Indeed is not an employer friendly job/resume board."
"Indeed is user friendly and convenient.  It also has options to advertise for free or to pay."
"Indeed is very easy to post a job"
"Indeed is well positioned in the market"
"Indeed platform works fine for my purposes"
"Indeed produces a lot of potential interviews if you pay to boost it. Of course most applicants are not qualified so there is a high weeding out process"
"Indeed provides quality service for the employer to evaluate the prospective candidates for an employment position."
"Indeed sent WAY too many resumes of people that had no qualifications whatsoeverWaste of my time to open and review them"
"Indeed was easy to use and provided great tools for sorting, tracking, and following up with candidates. The form letter suggestions were professional and easy to adapt."
"Indeed was easy to use, and I quickly found the candidate I was looking for."
"Indeed was great for finding candidates for employment!"
"Indeed was great to directly connect potential employees with the business. We were able to see when someone applied online and look at their resume."
"Indeed was helpful in our search - but we were overwhelmed with resumes from people who qualified at all for the jobs that were posted.  We had over 200 resumes to review for 1 position.  Indeed could help reduce the quantity and improve the quality."
"Indeed was useful to me up until those big changes that was made to the  to the platform. After those changes, we receive fewer responses from a posted application;  you inserted an Indeed email address everywhere on the applicants application and resumes, thus preventing us from reaching out to them; bottom line, we ended up paying more per responses received. Just not worth it to us anymore"
"Indeed worked very well for our need."
"Inefficient communication. I respond to the emails but continue to receive auto-generated emails requesting additional info. At first, Carson said it was because I sent him communications directly instead of using the portal, However, once I did use the portal nothing changed."
"Insufficient clarity of ""per day"" price when selecting advertising budget. Then not user friendly to use/access to curtail/modify ad afterward."
"Irrelevant candidate received and very low level of resume received."
"Issue is mostly ours, as it's likely the job we have available is more of a service sector job that would not generate a lot of inquiry from indeed users."
"It appears indeed twisted the job on other sites with different salary expectations. This mislead applicants."
"It depends upon the job. The positions with which I've had success are below a certain level."
"It did not yield a candidate for the position but the service is great."
"It didn't work for me"
"It doesn't work and cost a lot."
"It found XY Tool a proper candidate"
"It gave the ability to reach a wide network of individuals and provided almost instant results."
"It has a wide range of resumes so there are many well-qualified choices."
"It has been very helpful, user friendly and makes the process of hiring much easier"
"It is a little expensive with the PPC model and I find that I get a number of unqualified responses which costs me money...even though I have selection questions.  However, I do get a few good/qualified responses so I keep coming back."
"It is a valuable tool for finding candidates but has some limitations for us."
"It is a very good source of candidates"
"It is an easy platform to work in.  I like being able to track, make comments and communicate with the applicants directly through the site."
"It is an excellent service"
"It is easy"
"It is easy to use and available for free, which is really important for us, as we are a small non-profit with a shoestring budget."
"It is easy to use and has some really useful tools."
"It is easy to use and we get good results"
"It is easy to use, get a lot of responses."
"It is lacking in the things I need and isn't very user-friendly.  Navigation is horrible."
"It is n ot necesarrily your problem, but I have the qualifying questions and they don't not answer them accurately or honestly.    So that means I still have to go back and review all resumes which defeats the purpose of the questions.    I also think I get people who are on unemployment  adn just have to show they are looking for a job and have to submit so many appliations, so they take the easy way out and don't even read the posting they just apply.    I think you should have it that the candidate has to at least open the posting to read it."
"It is not your fault, but many of the applications we received were from people who had no experience and did not meet the minimun requirements for the job."
"It is the first service, out of many that I have tried, that I actually received the correct candidates for the position posted and was able to hire."
"It is very expensive for small businesses to afford to use your site and program."
"It is very overwheling all the responses that you get. I do not appreciate you listing an hourly wage of $10.00 an hour. We discuss the wage privately with the contacts."
"It just didn't work for me"
"It may be that I need to more fully understand the way indeed submits applicants' resumes to the employer, however, many of the individuals did not seem aware that their resume was submitted for our review.  We did have responses, however, a majority was from out of state and not really interested in relocation."
"It simply works."
"It was a good experience."
"It was clearly not communicated how the billing process is run.  I ended up with a $800+ bill for a 2 month period.  Luckily, a sweet customer service rep was able to refund the money.  In addition, several of the candidates that popped up did not respond to my requests for a phone meeting and /or interview.I will not use Indeed again"
"It was cost effective and resulted in a sufficient number of applicants"
"It was easy & we found a qualified individual quickly."
"It was easy and user friendly and didn't require me to talk on the phone to someone. We are a really busy office and I don't have time for sales calls but it was nice to know I had someone to contact if I needed them."
"It was easy to set up a job posting.  The features added have been helpful"
"It was easy to sort through candidates and made hiring much easier."
"It was easy to use"
"It was easy, convenient, and we were able to find some really good applicants."
"It was expensive, and to many of the candidates did not have the correct skills for the position.  It seems like folks are just applying for jobs, regardless of their fit for those positions."
"It was extremely simply to set up a job posting."
"It was helpful"
"It was ok for the most part"
"It was productive and successful for me and the job posting I had"
"It was quick and easy to find a number of qualified candidates."
"It was quick with excellent results and free."
"It was very easy and fast"
"It was very effective to get us alot of resumes"
"It was very helpful in finding an employee."
"It was very instrumental in providing me with the tools and the resources for my hiring needs."
"It wont help"
"It work S"
"It worked for us."
"It worked out really well for our situation. However, I better I rejected over half of the applicants as they were not qualified for the position."
"It worked well"
"It works well and inexpensive."
"It works.  Had many quality candidates apply for the position."
"It's a good way to get add out there.  But you get a lot of people replying that are not at all interested and never respond to my requests - I think they just do it to be able to tell unemployment they 'are looking' for job.  Also paying extra to 'sponsor' my ad after 1 week was a total waste - only received about 2 more inquiries after 1 week of applicants at no charge."
"It's a great place to advertise & with us not having any advertising in our budget we have limited resources."
"It's a rip off!Candidates are not screened. Customer service are a bunch of losers."
"It's become a chit chat forum for nonsense and I just don't have time for that in what is supposed to be a professional networking group."
"It's been a great tool in a lot of our locations."
"It's been a lot of money, barely got any candidates."
"It's free"
"It's free, and we have unlimited adds!  Also, decent candidates!"
"It's not often that people get a call or email based on the feedback they provide to a company and for that I have to applaud you and your employer. I have literally been using Indeed's services for over a decade and there have been many changes that have negatively impacted me over recent years which is why not only myself but many of the industry professionals that I speak with as well as many staffing firms/ agencies and even industry employers have stopped using Indeed. I'm sure for every customer Indeed gains today they lose one or two very loyal customers or people like myself that helped make Indeed what it is today.I also want to add that I have LOVED using Indeed and believe it or not but used to tell everyone in every industry about it as I had some success with it over the years. I didn't necessarily agree with starting to charge people to email candidates back in 2015/2016 timeframe and was able to get over that but when an Indeed rep. told me in late 2018 that I had to start paying to post jobs, that's when I told myself I had to go find the ""next"" Indeed. Indeed should know that there is so much competition out there and with other platforms/ services like Indeed and even more starting-up everyday (that are free like Indeed used to be) what would make anyone want to continue to utilize such an expensive resource?When I first started using Indeed and even though I didn't work for them I was doing so much marketing for the company because I believed in their service and vision. Recruiters (like myself) and HR professionals as well as staffing firms/ agencies and other industry clients pretty much built the networks/ databases that Indeed has because we were constantly posting positions all day, every day to attract talent from around the world to your site. Indeed pretty much started their business and became successful because of that model which likely didn't cost too much to have professionals like myself build their talent pool for them. Once Indeed felt they had a great network/ database of candidates they started charging the same people that helped build the brand and company, to view or reach out to the same candidates that we ultimately supplied to Indeed.At that point, I was still thankful that I could still post positions for free even though I couldn't look at the candidate database anymore because it was turning out to be quite a costly service at a dollar a click which you only got back if the candidate replied. Statistics in the industries that we work in show that about 20-30% of candidates actually return emails about jobs for many reasons (maybe they are already working, maybe they lost their password to that email or made new ones over the years, it's not enough money, they think the email is spam, the position is too good to be true, etc.) so that means for every $$1,000 I spend (which I can do easily in 2-3 days if I could afford it) I only get maybe $200-$300 back which simply doesn't work from a financial point of view.  Over the course of a year, if I spent $1,000 a week at $52,000 a year emailing candidates and only get $200-$300 back a week at $10,400-$15,600 a year then I lost a minimum of $36,400 a year and even if I do place several or even many candidates that I find on Indeed due to those efforts I still lost most of my money because the commission that I make off those people would never equate to the amount of monies I am spending using Indeed's services.Again, continuing to post great employment opportunities for free continued to drive your talent pools but it at least allowed candidates to review and respond to my positions if they had interest which was still quite helpful (you scratch my back I scratch yours right?) I thought that was the least Indeed could for me after spending 10+ years marketing for them and building their databases. Next thing I know someone from Indeed calls me and says you can no longer post jobs for free which means not only am I spending massive amounts of money to reach out to the candidates I've brought into their database but now I have to pay exuberant amounts of money to post my jobs too, it's a lose/lose situation.. That was the game changer for me and likely thousands of other professionals like me (which will continue) because if I/ we spend all our hard earned money paying for posts and candidate viewing then what good did we do ourselves?"
"It's quick, yielded many results"
"It's where all the best jobs are"
"It's worth the money and time invested"
"Its a good site"
"Its a great source to get candidates, but you do have to weed through a lot of people that don't qualify."
"It’s a Total scam"
"It’s an excellent tool to utilize both for an employer as well as a job seeker"
"It’s easy to  maneuver it has so many features & it’s free for a period of time."
"It’s free"
"It’s free. Although I was initially very frustrated with the lack of candidates showing up for interviews I was able to finally secure a reliable employee. I actually hired 7 from indeed in the past two years. One lasted for a year but the others all were gone before they received their first paycheck. Most of the applicants are concerned about the rate vs the actual job. Thanks"
"I’d let ppl know about indeed but I didn’t have any luck with ppl calling back or keeping their interviews"
"I’m not using the services and your charging me please refund my money"
"Job description is fairly simple to put in your system. Great responses to the resumes."
"Jobs recommended aren’t the right ones"
"Junk results"
"Just great working with the website."
"Just not satisfied with the results."
"Kaitlin and Sidney have been extremely attentive and helpful in helping to recruit the right candidate."
"Knocked off points because the platform is decent but there are some key issues (not able to sort candidates by a greater urban area, have to tick and untick each individual city which is tiresome)."
"Lack of candidates. Never received a call back from a rep. when I was told I would be called back. Software did not remove unqualified candidates. Price was very high for what was received."
"Lack of improvements to the search."
"Lack of qualified applicants"
"Lack of quality applicants"
"Lack of results and over priced"
"Lack of transparency on the process"
"Large candidate pool, ease of screening"
"Large group of candidates, easy process, great service, free"
"Large number of resumes received.  Reasonable price."
"Last two job postings we had with Indeed, we were able to hire a highly qualified candidate."
"Last year I had put in a job listing and someone called me to tweak the listing, which ended up costing me $500.  I then called to complain and was given a $200 credit to try again, and the listing continued to run after I had used up the $200 (which I was not aware of), and it continued to cost us money.  I therefore ended up spending way over my budget to end up not finding any candidates.  The person who helped me with the $200 credit gave me his number and email address, telling me I could call him at any time to get more help and when I did attempt to email he never answered me, but someone did leave me a message to increase my daily  budget yet again, which would have left me spending a crazy amount of money again, which I didn't want.   We are a very small private mental health practice, where we have not received increases from insurance companies in the 8 years we have been open.  Our profit margins are low to begin with, and spending that much money, especially to get no candidates, nearly killed us that month.  I feel Indeed was deceptive and only cared about making more sales from me..not about me or my business."
"Lately, I have found some good candidates on Indeed."
"Leads are not as good as Zip Recruiter."
"Leads are worthless and most were not even remotely qualified"

"Mez"
"Minimum cost is now $350/month"
"Most applicants are not a match for job posted"
"Most applicants didn't show for interview and it seemed like the people only wanted credit for applying for a job to keep their unemployment comp.  It used to be different and I always had success with indeed until now.  I just feel that I wasted so much time and I still haven't filled the positions-people just don't want to work."
"Most candidates lie on the screening questions so I am inundated with non qualified candidates and a waste of time. I was also solicited by an agency posing as a candidate who blatantly lied on all screening questions to get me to open the resume/solicitation memo"
"Most of the applicants were under-qualified and did not match even our minimum criteria, as posted in our ad.  Most had no relevant skills or experience.  A complete waste of our companies time & money!"
"Most of the candidates were not qualified for the position, wasted a lot of my time looking through people I couldn't even use. And after 10 days couldn't open up prospects to even look through their qualifications."
"Most people that apply don't have the requirements you ask for. So you get overwhelmed with too many applicants that don't have the experience you have asked for. Being 1 person to go through each and every applicant and then doing background checks for each and everyone that applied takes days to process, and at the same time you are trying to run your business."

"Of the two applications we received, their information was outdated and they did not respond back even though we reached out to them within an hour or two."
"Often the candidates who reply to job postings aren't remotely qualified or have any background in that particular field.  I would like to have more of a screening process, particularly when I'm now required to pay for postings as a recruiter.  I used to use Indeed a lot but I give it more thought now that I have to pay.  The fee to post has made Indeed like a lot of other posting sites rather than the go-to site it was for so long.  I would think you've seen a difference/decrease in the amount of traffic on the site.  Recruiting is a busy industry since most companies do not have the time or the resources to do their own recruiting.  I've been recruiting for the companies I work with up and down the east coast for 15 to 20 years and still being called on to present good qualified candidates to fill job openings.  I would be interested to hear if you decide you would like to return to serving recruiters and companies alike in the hiring process.  It was a good relationship until recruiters were treated differently and charged a fee."

"Our leads were poor quality this time overall."

"Our office acquired our needed manpower mostly from Indeed hence the highest rating given."
"Our post was very specific as to what the job requirements were as well as were we were located.  A large volume of  applicants responding or sent to us did not fit the requirements of the job and were outside our desired area.  We were very disappointed and do not feel the service will be used again."

"Pay rates aren't given for soma job postings. My wife will look at the same add and the pay rate is there for me it’s not. Then if you apply to a job it shouldn’t be visible in the daily search each and every day."

Added additional information in an effort to prevent this (as recommended by the Indeed staff), and it too was unsuccessful.  Just too expensive for lousy results."

"Response"
"Response was not as expected.   None of the candidates showed up for their interviews this time."

"Several applicants that we qualified"
"Several applicants were offered the position I was hiring for and never showed up for training shifts.  When I responded to several applicants, I informed them that they did not meet the minimum requirement questions.  They were snotty and stated that they saw no questions but were contacted by Indeed to say they were a good match."

"Sometimes we get good candidates, and sometimes a lot of junk."
"Spent a lot of money on ""clicks"" but none of the applicants ever responded back to us when we invited them for an interview."
"Still don't like the free option hidden in the system"
"Still have to filter through candidates that do not fit the recommended qualifications."
"Still not enough filters in place to eliminate resumes which do not meet the requirements of the job description."
"Strong response from candidates that was sent to me.. I did not have to go looking.Tracking and management tools were very good.SO much better response than your competitors and SO much more value for the money."
"Success in hiring new employees. User friendly and great customer service if you need help with anything."
"THE AMOUNT OF INTERESTED APPLICANTS WHOM APPLIED FOR THE JOB."
"Terrible candidates overall.  For the 1-3 candidates you do find out of 100, they may not even show up for the scheduled job interview."
"Terrible quality of candidates"
"The Indeed platform makes it TOO easy for people to apply. I have used Indeed now for a couple positions, and both times I have been flooded with applications from people who did not follow instructions and who were not qualified. It was a waste of time. The screening questions are a good attempt, and that made it easier to filter out a bunch of people, but my posting says to send a cover letter with the resume and only a few people -- literally fewer than 10 people, out of 80+ -- actually sent a cover letter. And from that, only a couple people's cover letters were even customized for the job. Most of them were completely generic and not helpful whatsoever. It makes me think that everyone who uses Indeed is lazy and doesn't pay attention -- not attributes that I want in candidates -- and whereas that might be true for some candidates, I can't imagine it's true for all of them. The platform makes it so easy that too many people don't pay close enough attention."
"The ad process was a bit confusing and in the end, I was over-charged."
"The amount of qualified persons and the show up rate is bad. We explained that we are a small fast passed fish restaurant and I was very open with people. And we pay well. so I don't know what is going on."
"The applications I received were not even close to being qualified."
"The applications were inexperienced and didn't match the qualifications we were looking for."
"The billing from Indeed is crazy..... I was unaware they would be charging me 500.00 for the services we received.  We had applicants that were unfit, with our requests."
"The billing is confusing. We never know how much we are going to pay."
"The billing is unclear and unreasonable. I didn't find any good candidates, I put in my ad Experience Mandatory, but then got all of these people clicking on my ad and sending me their resumes that didn't have any experience. I ended up paying for nothing."
"The candidates are horrible. I have to pay for the ones that don't meet my criteria and are rejected before I even get to see them. If they are rejected due to criteria not being met and put in a rejected folder automatically, then that should not be someone I am charged for. Regardless, the candidates are not good at all."
"The candidates are not qualified and when I hired one of your candidates, i learned through background and emplyment checks...she lied on her resume and had not worked in a year. Her resume - Misty Alverson - is still on your sight. You obviously did not care that she was deceptive and lied."
"The candidates for the position were mostly very unqualified for the position, got better and faster results using craigslist"
"The candidates that we got through the ad were either not qualified, or were looking for a position at least twice the amount we had listed in our ad."
"The candidates we got were not even close to the descripción we request to the person we need"
"The changes have been too restrictive for recruiting firms to conduct business"
"The circulation of job ad was excellent.  More flexible than other job search sites I inquired with."
"The combination of price, value and results"
"The compatibility of the candidates did not meet our expectation for the position."
"The cost"
"The cost of a job posting"
"The coverage that your service provides--people from all over can access it."
"The ease of use and the number of candidates that applied. I also appreciated the messaging communication method and the ranking system."
"The ease of using indeed! Like also the followup feature"
"The email chains between potential employees becomes extremely messy, website design could be improved."
"The engines works"
"The fact that there is no stop to weed out those that don’t meet application minimums. I had to weed through probably 200 out of the 415 applicants that didn’t have a bachelor’s degree or sales experience. Also, the fact that I asked the post to be taken down and it took more than 48 hours for that to happen, which means more resumes for me to weed through. I kept getting told it’s down on our end, maybe tomorrow it will be gone. And this went on for 3 days!!!"
"The fee structure seemed random: lots of charges over a long period of time."
"The few ads that did respond to our ad did not come close to the skill we needed.Some weren’t even auto mechanics !"
"The filtering of applicants needs to be improved ~ so many applicants have none of the minimum qualifications."
"The functionality is cumbersome and makes engaging with candidates time consuming. More importantly, I received so many applications from people not even remotely qualified for the role. I did talk to a few who seemed qualified and it felt apparent that they had just ""clicked a box"" and had no idea what the role was about.  Many took interviews while clearly engaged in other activities - a sign they weren't likely interested in the job.  I feel like I wasted so much time using Indeed and, ultimately, the strongest candidates and all of our finalists came through other sources as did the person we hired."
"The good response"
"The last 4 day run I had set up did not generate any candidates and that was a bit strange , also I prior use, the filter we use to specify the type of employee needed doesn’t match the people who apply."
"The last ad we placed had no hits and we were charged."
"The last candidate that I hired quit 1 week before starting abruptly.  Now I'm concerned about the quality of candidates you are providing."
"The mechanical skills test is amazing and pretty true. We really recognize the skills matching from our new employee"
"The mixed feelings I have regarding the service lead to a mixed recommendation. On one hand, I have received valid candidates from Indeed and hired them.The inability for the product to filter out multiple submissions from the same candidate and filter out people outside my geographic area make me feel that I overpay for what I receive."
"The numerous appropriate application that were received."
"The only media where we got any response to our ad for an employee"
"The people using indeed are not the kind of people who match up to what we do."
"The people we hired on here were very professional and were exactly what we we're looking for. Indeed made it super easy to see resumes and select which would be best for the position."
"The platform is excellent.  It manages many of the aspects of recruiting and qualifying candidates."
"The platform is not providing quality candidates."
"The price was too expensive and did not get qualified applicants"
"The pricing"
"The pricing models - Post a job or 30 emails are not cost-effective for recruiters who handle multiple requisitions."
"The quality of applicants wasn't the best, but we were able to find one candidate although they didn't fit all the requirements."
"The quality of candidates is horrible and your staff keeps calling my place of work to introduce themselves.  Why?  I stopped use of your service because I was getting flooded with candidates with little or no experience in the field they were applying and most did not even know what they were applying for on Indeed"
"The quality of candidates that I'm able to access."
"The quality of the candidates I received"
"The responses from applicants are not reliable."
"The return on the investment hasn’t met its worth $100 for 30 contacts is pretty expensive"
"The service and response were good."
"The service is ok but does not really help with the screening process very much."
"The site was easy to use"
"The site was very easy to maneuver around and I was able to get a lot of possible candidates."
"The support  help that was provided"
"The system didn't list my ad for hire."
"The system is easy to use, and extremely effective.. Thanks"
"The system is great helping finding a resource."
"The system was easy to set-up and use.  The reps were very helpful and informative; they walked us through the initial set-up procedures.  Once the candidates showed up on our Indeed account, screening them was very easy, and we were able to narrow down the applicants to only three for final in-person interviews.  And from those interviews, we selected  one candidate who has worked out very well for the past two months.  Indeed helped us to find the best person for our dental office!!"

"The website is user friendly and effective."

"The website was easy to use and reaching candidates and documenting the status of candidates was an excellent tool on Indeed."
"There are good job listings and notifications. The management assessments should be category related and less general."
"There is a wide variety of people that use Indeed.  It is easy to find qualified people."
"There is high probability of wasting your money for the industry I work.  We post jobs get enough impressions to fill the budget but seldom get any candidates.  You should consider a diminishing price scale the longer a job posting is up with no candidates."
"There is no cost to post a job opening."
"There was a high number of responses, which is needed to fill the roles."
"There was never any issue."
"There was some confusion with not receiving resume's that people sent through indeed. We never received any."
"There were so many applicants. It was difficult to get through them all. However, it was an easy way to get the applications which I would have needed to sift through anyway."
"There weren’t good candidates to choose from (with the amount of experience I’d listed in the posting). The one person I hired ended up being very unreliable, showing up late and not showing up to his shifts at all."
"Third guy in a row didn’t show up"
"This career website is by far superior to Career builders, Monster.com, and all the other competitors. We easily hire staff and the resumes are appropriate and meet the credentialing requirements and the process is so easy!"
"This is a paid for service but was not given direct emails for the candidate. This makes things extremely difficult for reporting purposes and my team having to contact every applicant individually to get that information."
"This option has not attracted the kind of candidates we've been looking for.  Many that have applied have no relevant background to the position."
"This portal was easy to use, and the better candidates utilized the job search features."
"This service was of great value to our city."
"This time I actually received resumes with that matched the position I was advertising"
"This time when we used indeed, we got few applicants and none were good fit for our store.  However the last time we hired (over a year ago) we hired off of indeed."
"This was my first time using indeed and I'm sure I'll use it again."
"Timely responses from Indeed and applicants"
"To expensive with a poor candidate pool. Many don’t show up when interviews are scheduled."
"To old, looks horrible like something from a 90s chat room. Price say too much."
"Too expensive"
"Too expensive and not good candidates"
"Too expensive and web site redesign is not user friendly.  I also had no response for qualified applicants.  When it was free, I hired several people through Indeed.  Now I spent money and did not get one new hire.  I still have job openings to fill."
"Too expensive.  I was not told by rep that I would be charged daily.  I wanted a simple listing and ended up getting charged $400.  Not worth it!!!"
"Too expensive.  The responses I received were not that good.  The few that I did contact never returned my call or email.I never spoke to ONE SINGLE potential employee.  A COMPLETE waste of my money.I had MAJOR difficulty cancelling with you folks to cancel the ad.  NEVER AGAIN!!  Plus, your people are rude."
"Too expensive. No idea if who sees our post or how to track. No matter how much I spend, I'm always told I need to spend more."
"Too many applicants.  Too few qualified applicants."
"Too many applications that were not qualified."
"Too many unqualified applicants"
"Too many unqualified applicants to screen through"
"Too many unrelated resumes"
"Too much “junk” to wade through. Free  services are not  good enough and the paid services are too expensive."
"Totally unhelpful platform for where we live."
"Traffic is pretty good, but very expensive. We invested about $2,300 to get 1 hire and 1 failed attempt.  I'd like to see that cost less (or get credits / no charge for applicants who ignore the posting requirements).  Thanks for asking."
"Tried it twice and did not get an employee either time."
"U guys ripped me of by charging way too much"
"USUALLY GET A NICE RESPONSE"
"Unable to contact candidate again due to quota of one"
"Unclear pricing and billing"
"Unfit candidates - drug test failing - poor offering"
"Unqualified applicants.  Received many resumes that were automatically sent to us and the ones we called to set up interview, had no idea who we were and that we had received their resume.  In addition, only 3 of the 10 applicants scheduled for an interview showed up...the others didn't even call to cancel."
"Unqualified respondents using up the budget!"

"Useless resumes. Poor quality candidates. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY RESUMES AND CANDIDATES."

"Volume of candidates and ease of sorting through those candidates to connect / respond to them."
"Was sent a nice pool of candidates to choose from"
"Was too expensive , wasn't able to hire anyone.  Most candidates were not hire-able and those who were, were too far away.  Only had one interview that the candidate actually showed up."
"Was unhappy with Billing and Ad sponsorship.Confusing billing as well.  Yet to receive any receipts for my Visa charges even though I requested.  Other sites careerbuilder...monster a little more black and white."
"Was very helpful and easy to navigate.gpot lots of responses"
"Was very specific about the experience that was needed by the candidates and all candidates that applied none had the experience that was required for the job. Still haven’t hired anyone from indeed."

"We are very pleased with the email correspondence."
"We definitely had more applications to choose from.  Most were not worth talking to."
"We did get a great amount of response."
"We did not find a candidate who had the qualification we required, licensed low voltage  technician. We are a small business and we do not have a large budget (in the thousands) to find a candidate. We have been in business for thirty plus years and the most we've paid is $500.00 to advertise for  qualified candidates."
"We did not get a good batch of candidates."
"We did not receive any candidates"
"We did receive several qualified applicants."
"We didn't receive any viable candidates for the positions that we posted. It felt like applicants were blindly applying without even reviewing the position description or requirements."
"We don't hire often, so it was hard to navigate. I'm sure it would be fine for someone used to it."
"We found a good candidate."
"We found a maintenance employee using Indeed."
"We found our employee through Indeed within several days.   We had an abundant of applicants and it was so easy to post.   Will definitely use Indeed again."
"We found several good applicants."
"We found the right candidate very quickly."
"We get flooded with candidates, but it's very clear that people aren't actually reading what the job is or what the application process is supposed to be. Being able to just send your resume is resulting in lots of unqualified people applying for our positions, i.e., a person with exclusively hotel concierge experience applying for a non-profit development director position or a manufacturing facility manager applying for a bakery production manager position."
"We get lots of responses to our posts."
"We get quality applicants"
"We get responses from mostly qualified candidates."
"We got a fair number of candidates.  I also thought the quality of candidates were better than we received from the other listings we had placed."
"We got a great match by using Indeed!"
"We got a large pool of candidates."
"We got basically no response from anyone from our add..7-8 resumes ... and not even what we posted about.. never have good success with indeed..AND you are way too expensive! Your competitors are much cheaper.. we spent a ton of money with you for nothing.. nonhappy"

"We had a good pool of people to choose from."
"We had a good response from the ad placed with Indeed and the cost was affordable."
"We had a great response from potential employees.  You really helped our first time needing to hire pretty painless."
"We had a lot of candidates, but most were not qualified. For the more skilled jobs that we posted, we had very few candidates."
"We had a lot of responses to the add it was not the hassle we dealt with on some competitor's sites."
"We hardly get any applicants. Were spending 2k a month and get very few applicants and the ones that do apply are not qualified. The filters for who can post dont work."
"We have been able to reach out and hire some very nice staff."
"We have been unable to find a good workforce pool from the site. I even had an incident where I was threatened by a potential employee."
"We have found several great employees from your site.  It's extremely user friendly and cost effective."
"We have found two excellent new people for our farm crews, and, (I know you said 1 reason, but there are 2), and the software makes it so easy to organize and store the applicants information, and to communicate and track the communication with the applicants."
"We have great luck with your site!"

"We have had good luck with Indeed"
"We have had success in finding a candidate through your website."
"We have hired 3 people since using Indeed and all are working out well."
"We have paid a lot of money for no shows and people that quit before training is over."
"We have unqualified candidates apply to our positions and it takes up money that we put towards our ad. Essentially making it a waste of our money."
"We have used your service for quite a while and I am used to it."
"We hired a new staff member using indeed and she's fantastic. We also received MANY resumes through this platform which was much higher than other platforms such as wine jobs."
"We hired excellent tutors, etc."
"We hired from Indeed !"
"We keep getting the same losers. They reapply then don’t show up for the interview."
"We made a written request to end the service on 3-7-2019 and we continue to be charged $100/month UNAUTHORIZEDIn addition, hundred of inappropriate resumes were sent to us."
"We paid a lot of money for us (we're small) and got no qualified candidates.  We filled the ps"
"We paid a lot of money to get several candidates.  Not one candidate had the background we were looking for.  The position offered was for an automotive service manager and not one of the applicants had any automotive experience."
"We really widened our candidate net and got excellent candidates."
"We receive an abundant amount of applicants from Indeed."
"We received a fair number of applications that we probably wouldn't have received otherwise."
"We received a good number of qualified candidates and it was free to use."
"We received a great response with quite a lot of resume's received."
"We received a high response from our ad.I had a call from a customer service rep who helped me get a better value option for mylisting which was very nice!"
"We received a lot of candidates but some did not have the criteria we needed.  Some resumes did not match the job description."
"We received a number of resumes, each day.  So we had quite a few applicants to choose from."
"We received applications from a lot of people who never responded to our email inquiries, so we can only assume that they either didn't know what they were applying for, or weren't seriously looking for employment.  Perhaps it's an issue with the wine industry more than others.  We also set interviews with people who didn't show up.  More than once."
"We received approx 45 responses and resumes from  your website. Not one of these turned out to be a viable candidate.Hired 3 of them and they never showed."
"We received credible applications from candidates for our position, including one from the individual whom we hired. Information provided from Indeed allowed us to evaluate the applicants so that our time interviewing was well-spent."
"We received many applications in a short period of time. Some were more qualified than others, but we were happy to see the interest. We hired someone because of your site."
"We received many qualified applicants, but I wish there was a way to narrow down the process more prior to bringing them in for an interview"
"We received many qualified prospects."
"We received mostly very unqualified applicants who did not thoroughly follow the application instructions."
"We received multiple qualified candidates, well worth the cost."
"We received numerous applications, not all related to our job specifications, but we were able to hire an individual."
"We received numerous applications."
"We received numerous good applicants and hired one of the."
"We received quite a large number of submissions and were generally pleased with the quality of qualified candidates."
"We received responses very quickly"
"We received the most replies through indeed."
"We received very promising resumes from your site. Thank you very much."
"We seemed to get a lot of individuals that were not even qualified for the position."
"We were able to find a good hire.  We spent money on you and Cool works and you produced."
"We were impressed by the number of applicants that we got from posting the job on your site."
"We were successful"
"We were unable to find the candidate (s) we were looking for.  Also, it seemed like we may have gotten double charged or charged a second time.  Can you check into that for us?"
"We were very pleased with the range of candidates responding and we were successful in appointing to the post advertised"
"We will use Indeed again.  It just seems that the sponsor fee did not get us what we hoped.  Most of our candidates did not come thru the sponsored contacts."
"We've found most of our current employees through Indeed"
"Weak candidates that did not match our requirements"
"Website interface is confusing and not user friendly. I ended up with $500 in charges that I did not anticipate for a service I did not find useful."
"Website is confusing and alot of wasted time by people just surfing jobs and not looking for real employment"
"Well because it seems that I was kicked from my services that I thought were free all of the sudden now I can’t post any jobs and I’m not going to pay for a service that won’t even allow me to put my company’s Actual link to the website so they can apply for jobs instead of having to do it twice because a lot of people who are trying to find a job find it annoying just do it the first time let alone doing it a second time."
"Well know website"
"Well organized and easy to use."
"We’ve had a lot of response to our ad and it was easy to set up."
"When I need help there is zero to no support and it’s takes days to get answers for simple questions"
"When I posted the job, I asked candidates to submit a cover letter with their resume.  Only 10 out of 29 applicants did so. I feel that candidates who use Indeed have their resume on file, they see a job opening and then they click apply for it, which means submit their resume.  They did not read the entire posting.  Second, the resumes are all stock resumes. I am not sure if this is something they build in Indeed but they look the same and have basic information - job, degree but their objectives and accomplishments or skills were all very weak."
"When I say I do not want anyone to apply who does not meet my specific requirements, I really mean it."
"While I fot a fair number of applicants, less than 5% or so actually met the stated criteria. So it took a lot of time to sort through the list. If I were to try again, I would have a better idea of what to change. Applicants were also very slow to respond, if they did at all. Two blew off multiple interviews."
"While Indeed was helpful is getting us a candidate for hire, the website and emails were a little tricky to use at times. It also would not let me connect my work email afterwards. I also didn't love be called by a representative trying to get me to use the paid version."
"While the position we were advertising for isn't a ""high demand"" position, we were able to find a potential candidate to fill the position.  The results of the search have been positive and satisfactory."
"While we have had some success in filling positions with the Indeed Hire feature, we've also gotten resumes that don't match our basic requirements.  Nevertheless, we still think this is a valuable tool that we will continue to use."
"While we receive resumes, none were from applicants that had the quailifications I required."
"Work flow and options available at each stage are excellent, and communications is easy to handle and works great!"
"Worked great!"
"Worst candidates"
"YALL ARE AWESOME!!!!!"
"You always have good candidates to pick from and have been very satisfied with the people that we have chosen."
"You are my main source to get employees"
"You are not willing to work with company's to make it easy for us to do business with indeed ."
"You charge too much to advertise with no insight to return on investment. Thw auction style marketing is ths same used by facebook, Google and others. It provides for no accountability. The reality is you have all the analytics to know exactly how long, how much money and how many hires actually occur in real life, but you will not make that info public because you are afraid it would harm your competitive advantage."
"You did everything you said you would, access was easy, we got many respondents for the position and all were good candidates."
"You did not deliver any results. Not one candidate had the qualifications I was looking for. You need to screen better. Very disappointed"
"You did not vet anyone when you sent resumeswe hired people who left before 30 days and were terrible.  They knew nothing but the resumes and vetting my your company had us hiring them.  Your service is inexpensive but more expensive in lost time and mistakes by your vetting.I will let every accounting company I know about the terrible experience I had with your company."
"You do a great job"
"You do not allow us to post jobs for free anymore"
"You forbid me from seeing perspective employees resumes. I did not violate any rules, and am a respected business and owner in my community. This is after also paying for your service. This is an injustice to everyone, employee and employers. I can guess at the reasoning but none of your agents can give me an answer as to why I have been restricted from viewing resumes.  And yes, I will highly NOT recommend, go out of my way to explain the truth, because whoever changed it, doesn’t have the foresight to see how this will effect Indeed."
"You found me a GREAT employee"
"You gave NO ONE that was 2 people out of 10 that were even qualified.  I am very disappointed!!!! I want my money back!!!"
"You gave a no one that could do the job that I have posted. we paid for this service and have no help from anyone at Indeed. I will be telling everyone that your service does not help the Employers when they are looking for help in the workforce.  Not only that when I saw that I was not getting the help that we need I asked for my money back and you said you would give and only gave me some of the funds that you said I would rec'd. You are a terrible company and word of mouth goes a lot further than you ever know."
"You get a lot of applicants who clearly are not qualified for the position.  Thirty people connected and only five were truly eligible to interview. Took up a lot of my time."
"You get a lot of candidates, but most are not even looking for s job. I feel they are using indeed to just show they are “applying” for a job because they aren’t even reading the requirements."
"You have a great platform. it's very easy for employers to post jobs and review candidates."
"You have an anonymous review on your site posted by a former disgruntled employee who was terminated after repeated violations of conduct code as well as not performing assigned duties even after multiple remediation attempts.  I would like to see this review removed.  I have put this in writing twice previously to your company to no avail.  If not taken down within 10 days, I will refer this issue of slander to my attorney.Sincerely, Wesley B. Smith, DDS"
"You have been very helpful. People see indeed and that is what we need."
"You have overcharged me since I cancelled last year in Sept 20-8. You owe me money on my card account at Credit One"
"You have some of the worst customer services I've ever experienced. I've had 5 different reps in 8 months. I don't even have one now. You also have a bias against employment agencies."
"You have to pay for clicks from unqualified applicants"
"You let me paying for an add that was outdated"
"You make it very easy to sit back and wait for candidates to come to us."
"You provided us with the candidates that we needed through our post"
"You receive over 100 responses that have no bearing on the job description."
"You rip people off by not making it easy to turn off the ad"
"You seem to list a wide array of potential jobs, which makes it easier for a candidate to be a little selective."
"You're charging exorbitant charges for some but not all job posts."
"Your billing system is ridiculous.  It should be a flat fee per month"
"Your charges are not clear.Poor quality and many unrelated people applied and sent resumes. I got same quality results as Craigslist."
"Your organization took time to communicate with me personally and sent me a continuous supply of applicants. I was very impressed! Thank you."
"Your person  put me on an account for this business that I did not authorize."
"Your price is very expensive , and the guys which they don’t match what I want but you send me the leads and charge mewithout matching, this is not fair"
"Your service did nothing but result in frustration.   I pay per click and got ZERO out of the money I spent.  I set 11 inter views and not a single one showed up.  The people who are using your service are the absolute bottom of the barrel."
"Your services provided me with no eligible candidates. I felt like it was a waste of money."
"Your site works for us"
"Your strategy is a RIP off. You advertise for free the first day and we receive five or six hits...none that are viable. You then send an email to us saying you need to do a deeper search.  For x dollars a day. Just charge a rate per day and stop wasting our time and money."
"Your system allows anyone and their uncle to apply for positions when they have absolutely no experience in the field.  That results in exorbitant fees with little productivity in finding a potential candidate."
"Your system works flawlessly."
"Your user interface is trash. The constant emails, notifications about new job postings- when I am an EMPLOYER, is nonsense. The lack of ability to sort and file resumes, etc. It's all just terrible- the ONLY value is the traffic."
"ZERO CANDIDATE WERE QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.Z E R OWish I could get my money back. SERIOUSLY ZERO."
"Zero customer service zero ability to connect with anyone whatsoever yet my bank is being charged when I don’t even have an active adI absolutely hate Indeed and will tell everyone that will listen"

"while we have not yet found a new hire we received some good contacts from your site"
